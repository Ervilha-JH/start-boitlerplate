# start-boitlerplate

Just a project to inspire others to start, that base is in TCP connections to determinate the auth in a web project, there is a way to turn all the connection that i`ll aplicate later with a auth to any other microsservice.

====================

To run you need just clone the projects and run
npm run install:all
npm run build
and start each project that you need to test, you can test all in one way
or one to one microsservice.

the ports 3000, 3001 and 3002 need to be open to use (but you can change this!)
